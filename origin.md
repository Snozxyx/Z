    Kitsune
    Re: Aria
    A decent amount of these origins are optimized/intended for combat purposes however the origins will improve for single-player use.
    🌸 Kitsune
    [+] Spirit Rush ( PRIMARY )
    You activate the Spiritual Energy you have gathered, allowing you to dash up to 3 times depending on the gathered amount.
    [=] Spiritual Gathering
    As a spiritual creature, you gradually gather Spiritual Energy by hitting people. This energy gathers up to 3 stacks and can be used with Spirit Rush.
    [+] Ictiokinesis ( SECONDARY )
    As a natural trickster, you’ve developed methods to help when you play with someone. You’ve gained the ability to turn invisible on command but only for a short period of time.
    [+] Pyralight ( PASSIVE )  [3 HIT]
    By attacking something, you slowly build up fire underneath your claws. After a few attacks(2), you may unleash that fire to your target, setting them ablaze.

    [=] Moonlight Meadow 
    Over time, you’ve adapted to the wilderness and have begun to use the night as a veil. During the night, you gain a small speed & strength buff. However, in exchange for this buff, you are weaker during the day.
    [=] Foxtrot: 
    As a fox yokai, you are naturally accepted by foxes around you. They both trust you and if you get attacked, they’ll fight on your behalf.

    [-] Canine Nature
    As a fox, you are considerably lighter. You have 9 hearts and can’t wear strong armor as a result of your smaller body. You have decreased reach thanks to your smaller arms and you may only eat meat.
    Hexecution
    The Hexecution is an ancient, very advanced steampowered automaton. With its creators long gone, the Hexecution has awoken from its slumber and now roams the lands with a newly formed concience.

    Neutral:
    Resource management: you need to watch your steam level. Accidentally using too much energy is not uncommon, and replenishing it when you ran out of power is not the easiest thing to do. Stand in water or consume (sneak-primary) a water bucket to fill your internal tank, consume charcoal (sneak-primary) to fill your heat level. Heat depleats over time and faster while in water. The more heat you accumulate, the faster water will be converted into steam.
    No bundles: you are unable to use bundles, for your own good.

    Advantages:
    Steam Arsenal: your core ability set consists of a dash, a slow jetpack, a portable crafting table and a unique drilling method.
    Augmentive Additions: you are able to augment your capabilities by installing augmentive items. Most of these augments come in the form of positive status effects, making your robotic body quite versatile. To install augments, put the ingredients inside a bundle (you can craft bundles and are given one at the start) and keep it in your offhand. While this bundle is in your offhand, its augments are active. Any active individual augment uses steam energy contnuously.
    Augmentive Additions (cont.): a couple augments do not grant status effects. These include automated water supply (water bucket), automated heat supply (lava bucket), and a glider pack that works in conjunction with the rocket dash (elytra).

    Disadvantages:
    Too hot: whenever you insert too much fuel and become too hot, you literally self-ignite.
    Low Power Mode: whenever you go under a threshold of steam; you gain slowness, weakness and hunger.
    Unwieldy: cant use a shield
    Fragile: to allow you body to glide and use your jetpack, your body was constructed to be very light, removing most armor. You have 3 less hearts than normal.
